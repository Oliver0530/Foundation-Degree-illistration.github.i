        <p>Illustration is a visually dynamic means of communication and demands imaginative, creative, versatile students willing
        to develop their own voice.
        <br>
        We have busy studios which are well-equipped, offer an energetic atmosphere and a friendly environment. Study includes
        practical and theoretical work embracing individual and collaborative activities.
        <br><br>
        In the first year of this programme At (Level 4), the curriculum offers exploration into the main genres of
        illustration, figure and character work, books, book binding, layout, typography, digital Photography and Creative
        Suite. The programme offers the opportunity to explore new technical processes with different staff, and, a module based
        around working with the public and a location (Work Based Learning). This takes place via six modules (20 credits each).
        <br><br>
        This level builds on your skills, being playful and increasing confidence in order to take creative risks. Each
        practical module is front-loaded with workshops to develop critical skills, semiotics and ideas generation, as well as
        broadened practical experience, print, figure drawing and digital skills etc. Learners are encouraged to challenge
        themselves, break boundaries, create, invent, explore and resolve ideas.
        <br><br>
        In the second year of this programme (Level 5), learners focus on their strengths, skills and personal passions to
        produce work with personality, and start to explore specific markets and genres. It is at this point â€‹that learners
        determine what qualities they want to improve upon and which areas they wish to research, bringing professional and
        entrepreneurial skills to their illustration.
        <br><br>
        There are critical and contextual and professional practice modules running alongside the practical modules that build
        critical understanding of theoretical and contemporary design and illustrative contexts; these are designed to help you
        see yourself as a practising designer/illustrator and to prepare you for possible further study.</p>
